# Algorithm

The ideia is to share some random algorithm, some basic stuff, so it may help new coders.
I plan to make each algorithm in one of those three languages: Java, Python and Javascript, depending on the algorithm, since it may be inconvinient to do in certain language.

I'll be using [@dannyfritz](https://github.com/dannyfritz) [commit-message-emoji](https://github.com/dannyfritz/commit-message-emoji) rules for commits. I thing it is a great ideia 😏.
